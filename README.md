# TimeandTemp

## What it does
Onload, the app uses geolocation and the Open Weather Map API
to retrieve and display current weather data and the next seven days' 
UV forecast for the user's location.

By clicking on the 5-Day-Forecast link at the top of the page,
the user can also retrieve their location's forecast for the next five
days, in three-hour increments, because that's how the Open Weather API
works.

## What if I want to see the weather of another locations?
Use the search field in the nav-bar at the top of the screen to search the 
current weather conditions of another location.

Unfortunately, the UV forecast for another locations cannot be saved at this time.

## Also...
Each location searched is saved locally in the user's browser. These saved locations
are then displayed, via a dropdown, under the LOCATIONS tab in the nav-bar.
These saved locaitons can be used to quick search the current weather information
for these locations.
